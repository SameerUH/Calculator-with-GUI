Today was brief session with relearning Flask and getting a file management system set up.

I have an idea already as to how I'm going to implement and create this projet but I'm not sure how well it's going to go.

Next commit I'm probably going to try and implement buttons in a table that print out the number they are in the vscode terminal.
